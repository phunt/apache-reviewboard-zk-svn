h1. Script to simplify submitting a ZooKeeper review via svn

*Author: "Patrick Hunt":http://people.apache.org/~phunt/* (follow me on "twitter":http://twitter.com/phunt)

h2. Summary

"This project":http://github.com/phunt/apache-reviewboard-zk-svn simplifies submitting ZooKeeper code reviews to reviews.apache.org

You need rbtools for this to work. If you're on ubuntu it's as easy as:

$ sudo apt-get install python-rbtools

Otherwise follow the instructions here: https://github.com/reviewboard/rbtools/blob/master/INSTALL (Apache is currently on 1.5.5 of RB which seems to require version 0.2 of rbtools - otw the login fails for me)

h3. What's Apache ZooKeeper?

From the "official site":http://hadoop.apache.org/zookeeper/: "ZooKeeper is a high-performance coordination service for distributed applications."

It exposes common services - such as naming, configuration management, synchronization, and group services - in a simple interface so you don't have to write them from scratch. You can use it off-the-shelf to implement consensus, group management, leader election, and presence protocols. And you can build on it for your own, specific needs.
